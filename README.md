# React To-Do App 📝

A simple, fully functional To-Do application built with React.js. This project supports creating, marking as complete, updating, and deleting to-dos, with data persisted in local storage to retain tasks across page refreshes. It’s a milestone in my React learning journey, showcasing core React concepts and fundamental front-end development practices.

## Features ✨

- **Add New To-Dos** – Create tasks easily
- **Mark as Complete** – Mark tasks as done with a single click
- **Edit and Delete To-Dos** – Update or remove tasks as needed
- **Persistent Storage** – Uses local storage to save to-dos across page reloads

## Installation 🚀

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamabraryeasir/React-Todo-App-Local-Storage-Context-API.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd React-Todo-App-Local-Storage-Context-API
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
